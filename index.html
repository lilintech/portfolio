            üë∂üèæ <b><span class="big">How I Found Myself Here</span></b><br>
             <p>I grew up around an old CRT Monitor computer (a pretty old machine lol) which my dad used sometimes. I was drawn to it cause I used to see people type so fast in movies. My main goal was playing around with all the games installed in the computer and in the process I remember encountering TypingMaster which I played for fun as there wasn't much apart from Microsoft Sollataire which I didn't know much about then. In the process I grew to enjoy typing and improving my speed. We had Cartoon Network games installed and it was a ride for sure. I recall one time the computer lagged and I got frustrated and just tinkered with all the keys in the keyboard, when I pressed a function key the game loaded and I thought it was such a genius move lol. With time, I learnt of Microsoft packages in school and started writing copies of storybooks my parents would buy for me for studies. This is how my passion for computers begun as a kid.</p>

             <p>I have a YouTube channel! Cloud Technology sparked an interest in me on 2023 and I figured why not learn it with people online through holding sessions in school and online? Below are some of the recording of the sessions I've hosted before.</p>
